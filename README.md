# matomari

A couple of MAL related scrapers and stuff like that, put together in a RESTful API.

Please, always remember that these scrapers are often not 100% stable for production, because when the layout of MAL changes, it won't work anymore. 

**Not ready for use in production yet.**

**I am in desperate need of a logo for matomari. I don't know, it could be anything, just unique. Something that represents matomari and only matomari.**

It needs to consist of:
- 256x256 PNG or JPEG picture (with optional transparency) so that I can resize it to a browser favicon as well.
- A banner or some sort to put on the GitHub README and on the documentation.

You can test matomari Version 0.4 live from the base URL of ```https://www.matomari.tk/api/0.4```

Docs will be added soon.

Each file contains information and parameters required at the top of the file.

The available methods are in requests.txt for now.
