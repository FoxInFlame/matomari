A couple of MAL related scrapers and stuff like that, put together in a RESTful API. Designed using PHP 7.


*Always keep in mind that third party scrapers such as this one are often not 100% stable for production, because when the layout of MAL changes, it won't work any more. It is however cached, and I try to fix any immediate problems as quick as I can, so it's usually fine.*
